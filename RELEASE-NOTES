*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_2_2_0 2006-05-23
    
    o added new CLI tools for key manipulation and encryption:
            glite-eds-key-register
            glite-eds-encrypt
            glite-eds-decrypt
            glite-eds-key-unregister
    o added new CLI tools for permission management:
            glite-eds-chmod
            glite-eds-getacl
            glite-eds-setacl
    o Added a CLI test suite.
    o Fixed the bin-to-hex routine for key storage: failed in some cases.
    o Fixed bugs:
        #17024: EDS: permission manipulation CLI
        #17023: EDS: I/O independent CLI tools

*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_2_0_0 2005-12-06 pkunszt

    o Fixed #14100: hydra-cli: glite-eds-encrypt command

*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_2_0_0 2005-12-06 pkunszt

    o Fixed #14098: encrypted storage does not work 
    o Make an interface change: the eds-client now registers always
      with the GUID. The LFN is not needed and there is no interaction
      with the Fireman catalog directly anymore (which was an unnecessary
      'vulnerability')
    o Add the following options to the glite-eds-* command liners:
       -s (was documented but not implemented - choose the io server)
       -i (set the ID)
       -u (for put: don't actually encrypt the file but do all the rest;
           dicom trigger use case)
    o fixed a potential problem: the glite-eds-get did do a hydra-unregister
      upon one of the failure modes - this is certainly unwanted and
      would've caused problems


*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_1_0_2 2005-11-01

    o API: it is possible to specify key size
    o CLI: it is possible to specify cipher and key size
    o cleanup function fixed
    o docs update (man pages and API doc)

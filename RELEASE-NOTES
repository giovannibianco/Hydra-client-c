*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_2_0_0 2005-12-06 pkunszt

    o Fixed #: encrypted storage does not work 
    o Make an interface change: the eds-client now registers always
      with the GUID. The LFN is not needed and there is no interaction
      with the Fireman catalog directly anymore (which was an unnecessary
      'vulnerability')
    o Add the following options to the glite-eds-* command liners:
       -s (was documented but not implemented - choose the io server)
       -i (set the ID)
       -u (for put: don't actually encrypt the file but do all the rest;
           dicom trigger use case)
    o fixed a potential problem: the glite-eds-get did do a hydra-unregister
      upon one of the failure modes - this is certainly unwanted and
      would've caused problems


*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_1_0_2 2005-11-01

    o Fixed #7540: man pages in the wrong place?
    o Document function parameters properly
    o Document cipher parameters properly for CLI
    o Fixed slc build


*** Release glite-data-hydra-cli_R_1_0_1 2005-10-20

    o API: it is possible to specify key size
    o CLI: it is possible to specify cipher and key size
    o cleanup function fixed
    o docs update (man pages and API doc)

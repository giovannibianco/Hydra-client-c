		<para>
		    Specifies the service endpoint to use.
		    If <option><replaceable>SERVICE</replaceable></option> starts
		    with <userinput>http://</userinput>, <userinput>https://</userinput> or 
            <userinput>httpg://</userinput>,
		    then it is taken as a direct service endpoint URL.
		    Otherwise <option><replaceable>SERVICE</replaceable></option> is taken as
		    a service instance name and Service Discovery is invoked to look up the
		    endpoint.
		</para>
		<para>
		    If this option is not specified, Service Discovery will be invoked and
		    the first available catalog will be used. If the Service Discovery
		    fails, the program will exit with an error.
		</para>
		<note>
		    <para>
			If this option is not specified, only services with a known good status
			will be returned by Service Discovery. However if you explicitely specify a
			service name or an endpoint, the tool will try to use it regardless of its
			registered status.
